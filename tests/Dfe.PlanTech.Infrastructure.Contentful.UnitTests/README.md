### With Code Coverage

To run the tests and generate unit coverage, run ``` dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" ``` from the project root folder instead

#### Generating HTML Reports

Run the following command from the project root folder:

```shell
reportgenerator \
-reports:"TestResults/{guid}/coverage.cobertura.xml" \
-targetdir:"coveragereport" \

```

Where "guid" is the relevant folder GUID from the generated tests. Alternatively, navigate to the relevant folder in your terminal, and replace the reports argument with just ```"coverage.cobertuna.xml"```
