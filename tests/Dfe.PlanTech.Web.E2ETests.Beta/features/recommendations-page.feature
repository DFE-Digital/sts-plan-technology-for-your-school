    Given I start a test assessment on "Category One Section One" with answers "1, 1"

    And I should see the recommendation caption text "Recommendation 1 of 3"
    And I should see the GOV.UK footer with expected links
    And I should see the paragraph text "This is a high maturity recommendation intro text" inside the recommendation content

    Then I should see the related actions sidebar
    And the sidebar link with text "View or update your self-assessment for category one section one" should have href "/category-one-section-one/change-answers"
